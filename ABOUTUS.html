	<br><br>
<font style="font-family:Tempus Sans ITC;">
American Chinese cuisine is a style of 
Chinese cuisine developed by Americans 
of Chinese descent. The dishes served in
 many North American Chinese restaurants 
 are adapted to American tastes and often 
 differ significantly from those found in China.
<br>


Chinese immigrants arrived in the United States
 to work as miners and railroad workers. As the 
 large groups of Chinese immigrants arrived, laws 
 were put in place preventing them from owning land. 


	<br>
<font style="font-family:Lucida Calligraphy; padding-left:100px;" color="red">19th Century</font>	
<br>
	<br>
By the 19th century, the Chinese community in San Francisco
 operated sophisticated and sometimes luxurious restaurants
 patronized mainly by Chinese. The restaurants in smaller
 towns (mostly owned by Chinese immigrants) served food
 based on what their customers requested.


These smaller restaurants were responsible 
for developing American Chinese cuisine, 
where the food was modified to suit a more 
American palate. First catering to miners 
and railroad workers, they established new 
eateries in towns where Chinese food was
 completely unknown, adapting local ingredients 
 and catering to their customers' tastes. Even 
 though the new flavors and dishes meant they
 were not strictly Chinese cuisine, these 
 Chinese restaurants have been cultural 
 ambassadors to Americans.

 <br>
 <br>
 <font style="font-family:Lucida Calligraphy; padding-left:100px;" color="red">1920s</font>	
 
  <br>
 <br>
Along the way, cooks adapted southern Chinese dishes 
such as chop suey and developed a style of Chinese food
 not found in China. By the 1920s, this cuisine, particularly
 chop suey, became popular among middle-class Americans.
 Late 20th century tastes have been more accommodating. 
 Take away food became popular amongst Americans, Chinese
 food becoming a favourite "take out" option.

 <font style="font-family:Lucida Calligraphy; padding-left:100px;" color="red">California gold rush</font>	
 
  <br>
 <br>
 
Chinese restaurants in the United States began during the 
California gold rush, which brought twenty to thirty thousand 
immigrants across from the Canton (Guangdong) region of China. 
By 1850, there were five restaurants in San Francisco. 
Soon after, significant amounts of food were being imported 
from China to America's west coast. The trend spread eastward 
with the growth of the American railways, particularly to New 
York City.
